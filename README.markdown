# Paren Test

### Parenscript testing framework. Works, but it needs love to be more lovable.

Note: By default Paren Test tries to execute the javascript generated by parenscript through spidermonkey. It assumes spidermonkey is installed and in the PATH. If you want to exxecute the javascript using node instead, after loading paren-test evaluate the following expression in the REPL:

    > (setf paren-test:*js-executable* "node")
